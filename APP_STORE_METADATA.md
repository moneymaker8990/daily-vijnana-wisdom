## Description (App Store)

**Embark on a 365-day journey through the world's greatest wisdom traditions.**

MindVanta weaves together teachings from the Vijnana Bhairava Tantra, Tao Te Ching, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita, and Shiva Sutras into a single, elegant daily practice.

**What You'll Experience:**

• **Daily Wisdom** - Each day offers carefully curated passages from multiple sacred traditions, with modern psychological insights that make ancient wisdom immediately applicable.

• **Guided Meditations** - Built-in timer with gentle bells, paired with daily meditation instructions drawn from each teaching.

• **Sacred Library** - Full access to complete texts from seven wisdom traditions, searchable and annotated.

• **Dream Journal** - Record your dreams and receive AI-powered interpretations through the lens of Jungian psychology and contemplative spirituality.

• **Track Your Journey** - See your progress through the 365-day curriculum, bookmark favorite passages, and share insights with friends.

**A Different Kind of Meditation App:**

This isn't about optimizing your productivity or reducing stress (though that may happen). MindVanta is for those who sense there's something deeper—who want to explore the nature of consciousness itself.

The teachings are presented in a "Mystic Modern" voice: psychologically grounded, spiritually mature, and never preachy. Whether you're new to contemplative practice or a longtime seeker, you'll find wisdom that meets you where you are.

**Premium Features:**
• Complete Sacred Text Library (700+ verses)
• AI Dream Interpretation
• Unlimited Favorites
• Custom Reminder Times
• Offline Access

Start your journey today. One day, one teaching, one breath at a time.
