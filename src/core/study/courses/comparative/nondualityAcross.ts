      title: 'One Truth, Many Names',
      introduction: `Every mystical tradition points to a reality beyond ordinary perception—beyond the division of self and other, subject and object. The Upanishads call it Brahman. The Taoists call it Tao. Christians call it God. Buddhists speak of Emptiness or Buddha-nature.

Are these different realities? Or the same reality seen through different lenses?

This course doesn't try to erase differences. Each tradition has its own beauty, its own wisdom, its own unique gift. But beneath the surface, mystics across all traditions report remarkably similar discoveries: a oneness beyond words, a peace beyond understanding, a self that is no-self.

Let's explore these convergences—not to prove anything, but to deepen our appreciation for the perennial wisdom of humanity.`,

        'tao-1',         // "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao"
        'kena-3',        // "There the eye goes not, speech goes not, nor the mind"
        'cloud-1',       // "He cannot be thought... by love He can be grasped"
        'mumon-27',      // "It is not mind. It is not Buddha. It is not things."
      ],
      traditionalContext: 'Each tradition acknowledges that ultimate reality transcends language. The Tao that can be named is not the true Tao. Brahman is "not this, not this." God is known in the Cloud of Unknowing. Zen says: "not mind, not Buddha, not things." The very impossibility of naming points to the same nameless truth.',

      title: 'The Witness in All Traditions',
      introduction: `Across traditions, we find the teaching of a witness—pure awareness that observes but is not touched by what it observes. In Vedanta, this is the Sakshi, the "seer of the seen." In Zen, it's the "original face before your parents were born." In Christianity, it's the still, small voice within.

The Ashtavakra Gita declares: "You are the one witness of all, and are always totally free." The Tao Te Ching speaks of emptying and returning to the source: "The ten thousand things rise and fall while the Self watches their return."

This witness is not passive. It is the light by which all things are known—luminous, aware, untouched by the passing show.`,
      verses: [
        'ashtavakra-1-7', // "You are the one witness of all"
        'tao-16',         // "The ten thousand things rise and fall while the Self watches"
        'mumon-12',       // Zuigan: "Master! Are you awake?"
        'brihad-3',       // "Neti neti—not this, not this"
        'cloud-26',       // "When you feel you are doing nothing, closest to God"
      ],
      traditionalContext: 'Vedanta\'s witness (Sakshi), Taoism\'s return to the source, Zen\'s original face, and Christianity\'s resting in God all point to the same recognition: there is something in you that watches, that is aware, that is always already present and free.',

        'Can you find the same witness presence in meditation, regardless of the tradition?',
        'What is it that is aware in this moment? Does it have a religious affiliation?',

      title: 'Emptiness and Fullness',
      introduction: `Buddhism emphasizes emptiness (shunyata)—the teaching that all phenomena lack inherent existence. Vedanta emphasizes fullness (purna)—the teaching that Brahman is the infinite whole. Are these opposites?

Deeper exploration reveals they point to the same reality. The Heart Sutra declares: "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form." The Upanishads declare: "From fullness, fullness comes; take fullness from fullness, fullness remains."

The Tao Te Ching bridges both: "The Tao is like an empty vessel that may be used but never filled." Empty and full, void and plenum—the ultimate reality transcends both concepts while being pointed to by each.`,
      verses: [
        'prajnaparamita-1', // Heart Sutra: "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form"
        'isha-1',           // "All this is to be pervaded by the Lord"
        'tao-4',            // "The Tao is like an empty vessel"
        'tao-11',           // "It is the space within that makes it useful"
        'avd-1-6',          // "As space inside and outside a jar is the same"
      ],
      traditionalContext: 'Buddhist emptiness and Vedantic fullness appear opposite but meet in the middle. Emptiness means not empty of existence but empty of separate, independent reality. Fullness means not full of things but full of awareness, of being. Both point beyond the opposites to the non-dual.',

        'How can something be both empty and full?',
        'Is the space in this room empty or full? Both? Neither?',

      title: 'The Ego\'s Dissolution',
      introduction: `Every wisdom tradition teaches that the sense of a separate, solid self is the root of suffering—and that freedom comes through seeing through this illusion.

In Buddhism, this is anatman (no-self). In Vedanta, it's recognizing the ego as an appearance within Brahman. In Christianity, it's dying to self to live in Christ. In Taoism, it's wu-wei—acting without the interference of the self-aggrandizing ego.

The Dhammapada says: "All that we are is the result of what we have thought." The Ashtavakra Gita declares: "You are indeed ever free"—the bondage was only to an imagined self. The Cloud of Unknowing instructs: "Do not think about what you are, but think about what God is."`,
      verses: [
        'dp-1-1',         // "All that we are is the result of what we have thought"
        'ashtavakra-1-8', // "I am the doer—drink the nectar of 'I am not the doer'"
        'cloud-35',       // "Do not think about what you are, think about what God is"
        'tao-7',          // "The sage puts himself last and finds himself first"
        'mumon-41',       // "Bring me your mind and I will pacify it"
      ],
      traditionalContext: 'Buddhist no-self, Advaita\'s dissolution of ego into Brahman, Christian death to self, and Taoist selfless action all address the same fundamental illusion: the belief in a separate, solid "me." Each tradition offers practices to see through this illusion.',

        'What do all traditions agree is the problem with the sense of "I"?',
        'Is the "I" that practices Buddhism different from the "I" that prays to God?',

      ],
      practice: {
        title: 'Cross-Tradition Self-Inquiry',

          'Sit quietly. Ask: "Who am I?" (Vedantic approach)',
          'Look for the one asking. Can you find a solid self?',

    {
      id: 'nac-5',
      title: 'Love and Knowing',
      introduction: `Western mysticism often emphasizes love as the path to God. Eastern traditions often emphasize knowledge or awareness. Are these different paths to different goals?

The Cloud of Unknowing is clear: "By love He can be grasped and held, but by thought never." Yet the Upanishads declare: "Knowing Brahman, one becomes Brahman." And Zen speaks of wisdom and compassion as two wings of one bird.

Perhaps love and knowing are not opposites but two aspects of the same reality. In the deepest love, there is no separate lover. In the deepest knowing, there is no separate knower. Both dissolve the boundary between self and other.`,
      verses: [
        'cloud-10',       // "To the knowing power, God is incomprehensible; to love, fully comprehensible"
        'brihad-2',       // "Aham Brahmasmi—I am Brahman"
        'dp-1-5',         // "Hatred never ceases by hatred... by love alone"
        'narada-1',       // Narada Bhakti Sutra on supreme love
        'chandogya-2',    // "Tat tvam asi—That thou art"
      ],
      traditionalContext: 'Christian mysticism\'s path of love (via amoris) and Vedanta\'s path of knowledge (jnana) seem different but converge. In Bhakti, love dissolves the lover into the beloved. In Jnana, knowledge dissolves the knower into the known. Both end in union.',

        'Is there knowing without some form of love? Is there love without knowing?',
        'When you deeply love, where is the boundary between you and the beloved?',
        'When you deeply know something, who is the knower and what is known?',
      ],

        title: 'Union of Love and Knowledge',

      title: 'Already Here, Already Free',
      introduction: `The final teaching across traditions is perhaps the most radical: you don't need to go anywhere. Enlightenment, salvation, liberation—it's not a distant goal but a present reality obscured by seeking.

Zen says: "This very mind is Buddha." Advaita says: "You are already free." The mystic Meister Eckhart said: "If you seek God and seek nothing else, you will find that God is with you, for God is where your eye is."

The search itself becomes the obstacle. Every tradition, in its deepest teaching, points to this: stop seeking and recognize what has always been here.`,
      verses: [
        'mumon-30',       // "This very mind is Buddha"
        'ashtavakra-5-4', // "You are complete, even now"
        'tao-47',         // "Without going out, you may know the world"
        'cloud-28',       // "A naked intent toward God in the depths of your being"
        'dp-7-1',         // "No suffering for one who has finished the journey"
      ],
      traditionalContext: 'Zen\'s "already Buddha," Advaita\'s "already free," Taoism\'s "return to the source," and mystical Christianity\'s "God within" all point to the same recognition: what we seek is what we already are. The seeker is the sought.',

        'If you are already what you seek, why do you keep seeking?',
        'What happens when the search stops?',
        'Can you find this "already here" quality in each tradition\'s teaching?',
      ],
      practice: {
        title: 'Resting in the Already-Here',
        duration: '20 minutes',
        instructions: [
          'Sit in stillness. Do nothing.',

          'Notice: this moment lacks nothing.',
          'Every tradition points to this—what is already the case.',
