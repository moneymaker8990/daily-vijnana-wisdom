If a person speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the cart.', translator: 'Max Müller', tags: ['action', 'suffering', 'inquiry'], difficulty: 1, commentary: 'The Dhammapada\'s opening verse establishes the Buddha\'s core insight: mind is the creator of our experience. The metaphor of the wheel following the ox is precise—the consequence is not punishment but natural law.

The good news: by working with the mind, we can change everything.' },
