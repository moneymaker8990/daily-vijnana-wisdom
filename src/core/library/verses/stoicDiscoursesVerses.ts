How far does the grammatic art possess the contemplating power? As far as forming a judgment about what is written and spoken. And how far music? As far as judging about melody. Does either of them contemplate itself? By no means. But when you must write something to your friend, grammar will tell you what words you should write; but whether you should write or not, grammar will not tell you.', translator: 'George Long', tags: ['reason', 'judgment', 'inquiry'], difficulty: 3, commentary: 'Epictetus opens by distinguishing the unique power of reason: it alone can examine and judge itself, unlike any other faculty.' },

Within our power are opinion, aim, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever affairs are our own. Beyond our power are body, property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever are not properly our own affairs.', translator: 'Elizabeth Carter', tags: ['control', 'freedom', 'choice', 'judgment'], difficulty: 1, commentary: 'The foundational dichotomy of control — the bedrock of all Stoic practice.

If you are going to bathe, put before your mind what happens at the bath — the splashing, the jostling, the abusive language, the pilfering. And thus you will more safely go about this action if you say to yourself, I will now go bathe, and keep my own will in harmony with nature.', translator: 'Elizabeth Carter', tags: ['discipline', 'acceptance', 'equanimity'], difficulty: 2 },

When we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never blame others but ourselves — that is, our own judgments. It is the act of an ill-instructed man to blame others for his own bad condition; it is the act of one who has begun to be instructed, to lay the blame on himself; and of one whose instruction is completed, neither to blame another, nor himself.', translator: 'George Long', tags: ['judgment', 'discipline', 'virtue', 'inquiry'], difficulty: 2 },
