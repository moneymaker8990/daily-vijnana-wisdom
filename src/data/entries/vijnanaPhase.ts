    whyThisMatters: {
      vijnana: 'This teaching interrupts the habit of identifying with mental content and points you back to the awareness that is always already present.',
      tao: 'The Tao reminds us that the deepest truths slip away when we try to cage them in concepts—relaxing the grip of the conceptual mind opens direct experience.',

    integratedReflectionBody: 'All sensations, emotions, and cravings arise within the vast space of awareness. You are not the movements—you are the field that holds them. Think of the moment just before falling asleep—when thoughts slow and the usual sense of "me" softens. That spaciousness is not a special state; it is what you are. Today, return again and again to the quiet center that requires no explanation. This is your first day of a 365-day journey.',

    integratedReflectionBody: 'The pause between breaths is a doorway into clarity. In stillness, the mud settles; in the gap, awareness brightens. You know this feeling—that brief moment after a sneeze, or when you step outside into cold air. The mind stops. Something opens. Your strength today is timing—pausing when it is time to pause, and moving only when the movement is true.',

    integratedReflectionBody: 'Every intense sensation is an invitation. When you allow yourself to fully enter the intensity without resistance or grasping, you discover that at its core is pure awareness itself. Think of stubbing your toe—for a split second, there is only the sensation, no "you" experiencing it. That split second is the doorway. Today, practice meeting what arises with complete presence.',

When attention is placed there with devotion, the fire climbs—burning through dullness, dissolving heaviness, illuminating the inner world. You may have felt this after deep laughter or sudden inspiration—a warmth spreading upward, a sense of lightness. This is not visualization but recognition of what is already present.',
