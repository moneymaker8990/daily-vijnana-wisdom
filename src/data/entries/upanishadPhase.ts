    integratedReflectionBody: 'We enter the Upanishads with a question that has no easy answer: What is it that hears through your ears? Not the ear itself—the ear is just an instrument. Something uses the ear, something prior to the ear. Notice when you are surprised by a sound—for a split second, there is just hearing, before "you" show up to interpret. Today, we begin to shift attention from what is heard to the hearing itself, from content to the awareness that knows content.',

Like the eye that cannot see itself, awareness cannot be made into an object. Yet it can be recognized. Think of how frustrating it is when you cannot remember a word—and then it comes, unbidden.
