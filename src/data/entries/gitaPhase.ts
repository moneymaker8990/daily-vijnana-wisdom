    integratedReflectionTitle: 'The Steadiness Within Change',
    integratedReflectionBody: 'The Bhagavad Gita opens in the midst of conflict—not peaceful retreat but the battlefield of life. Krishna\'s first teaching to Arjuna is about impermanence: sensations come and go, pleasure and pain alternate like seasons. Think of how quickly a mood can shift—one piece of news changes everything. Yet something watches these shifts, unchanged. What remains steady is the witness. Today, practice standing firm while everything moves around you.',

    integratedReflectionTitle: 'What Cannot Be Destroyed',
    integratedReflectionBody: 'Fear of loss, fear of death, fear of change—these all rest on the assumption that we are destructible. But the Gita points to that which pervades the body yet is not the body. It cannot be cut, burned, wetted, or dried. Think of deep dreamless sleep—"you" disappeared, yet something continued. Recognizing this, fear loses its foundation.',

    },
    integratedReflectionTitle: 'The Witness of All Action',
    integratedReflectionBody: 'Actions happen. Bodies interact, compete, conflict. But the Self—pure awareness—is never the doer, never the done-to. Think of watching a movie—you feel emotions, your heart races, yet "you" are untouched in the seat. Understanding this is not spiritual bypassing; it is the deepest truth from which right action can flow. Today, recognize the untouched witness.',
