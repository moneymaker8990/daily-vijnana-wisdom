The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth. The named is the mother of ten thousand things. Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations. These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery.', commentary: 'The opening verse establishes that ultimate reality transcends language and concepts. What can be spoken points toward truth but is not truth itself.', keywords: ['Tao', 'nameless', 'mystery'] },
    { id: 'tao-2', number: 2, chapter: 2, text: 'Under heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness. All can know good as good only because there is evil. Therefore having and not having arise together. Difficult and easy complement each other. Long and short contrast each other. High and low rest upon each other. Voice and sound harmonize each other. Front and back follow one another. Therefore the sage goes about doing nothing, teaching without words. The ten thousand things rise and fall without cease.', commentary: 'All qualities exist in relation to their opposites. The sage understands this interdependence and acts without forcing.', keywords: ['duality', 'opposites', 'non-action'] },
    { id: 'tao-3', number: 3, chapter: 3, text: 'Not exalting the worthy prevents quarreling. Not prizing rare possessions prevents stealing. Not displaying what is desirable prevents confusion of the heart. The wise leader empties their mind, fills their belly, weakens their ambition, and strengthens their bones. Practice not-knowing and not-wanting, and all will be in harmony.', commentary: 'Simplicity in leadership and life reduces conflict. When people are not stirred by competition and desire, peace arises naturally.', keywords: ['simplicity', 'leadership', 'contentment'] },

It softens extremes and harmonizes differences.', keywords: ['emptiness', 'origin', 'softening'] },
    { id: 'tao-5', number: 5, chapter: 5, text: 'Heaven and earth are impartial; they treat all things as straw dogs. The sage is impartial; they treat all people as straw dogs. The space between heaven and earth is like a bellows: empty yet infinitely capable. The more you use it, the more it produces. The more you talk of it, the less you understand.

In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be present.

If heaven and earth cannot make things last forever, how is it possible for humans? One who follows the Tao becomes one with the Tao. One who follows virtue becomes one with virtue.
